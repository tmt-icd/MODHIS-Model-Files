description = """
The On-instrument Wavefront Sensor (OIWFS) Environment assembly controls and monitors the OIWFS enclosure environment. The enclosure shares the internal environment of NFIRAOS: attached to the bottom port of NFIRAOS, both light and air pass freely between the two instruments when the NFIRAOS bottom port valve is open. The OIWFS Enclosure ensures that the OIWFS is cooled to the same -30 C as NFIRAOS (to avoid creating thermal plumes, and therefore additional sources of wavefront error), and is also airtight to maintain the slight positive pressure achieved within NFIRAOS with respect to the ambient atmosphere in order to avoid humidity from entering the combined system. Sensors monitor temperatures (including air temperatures, refrigerant temperatures, and surface temperatures of both the enclosure itself, and motors belonging to mechanisms within the enclosure and the instrument rotator), air pressures and humidities. The OIWFS Enclosure is not to be confused with the three OIWFS detector cryostats.
