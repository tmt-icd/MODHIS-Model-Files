This will tell the enclosure to change the state of the gate valve at the bottom of the snout.

If conditions will pose a hazard to the enclosure conditions (such as the enclosure is running cold and the OIWFS is not connected to NFIRAOS, then the command will be rejected.  This command will also be rejected if the environmental conditions pose a hazard (such as the temperature differentials greater than 0.5 degrees Celsius may cause frost/condensation).  When evaluating the environmental conditions, the OIWFS envlosure will consider not only the current conditions of the enclosure and gate valve, but also the current conditions of the snout, NFIRAOS (when connected) and ambient environment (when not connected to NFIRAOS).

It is in general possible to close the snout gate valve at any time.
